                    Tools for making web products without code have been around in one shape or form for awhile. Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of
                    significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. code altogether.
                    Thus, with a simple syntax, this language becomes incredibly beginner friendly, and in now one of the most popular programming language.

                    Java has been one of the most popular programming language for many years. Java is Object Oriented. However it is not considered as pure object oriented as it provides support for primitive data types (like int, char, etc) The Java codes are first compiled
                    into byte code (machine independent code). Then the byte code is run on Java Virtual Machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying architecture. Java syntax is similar to C/C++. But Java does not provide low level programming functionalities
                    like pointers. Also, Java codes are always written in the form of classes and objects. Java is used in all kind of applications like Mobile Applications (Android is Java based), desktop applications, web applications, client server
                    applications, enterprise applications and many more. When compared with C++, Java codes are generally more maintainable because Java does not allow many things which may lead bad/inefficient programming if used incorrectly.

                    C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional
                    features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It has gained it's fame as the most sought after programming language for game developers and thus becomes the most important language as far as the gaming and entertainment
                    industrty is concerned.
